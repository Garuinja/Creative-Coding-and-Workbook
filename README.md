### Brief Account of Experimentation
- Made a few boxes and gave them each a function where if the mouse was ever on top of them they would randomly move about and change colour. For one particular box if the mouse clicked on its position the box would stay randomly moving and changing it's colour and if the mouse were to click on the box again it would stop.

### Future Development
- Want to put the boxes in some kind of neater order and refine the movement and colour switching a bit.

I have decided to make a work based on the theme of glitches. My first idea towards this idea would be to have some objects glitch out every now and then. I used boxes since they're the most simple object shape which would make it easier to manipulate and get ideas on how the code would be working. I then wanted to have the boxes glitch out when the mouse hovers over the boxes to symbolise the troubles hidden within people.

I wanted to try and see if I can get a box to stay glitching out. To do this I will have the users click on the box to make it stay glitching out and then they can click on it again to make it not glitch.

I have an idea which is to have the boxes constantly moving and then have them stay in one spot when they glitch out.

### Brief Account of Experimentation
- Made a few boxes and gave them each a function where if the mouse was ever on top of them they would randomly move about and change colour. For one particular box if the mouse clicked on its position the box would stay randomly moving and changing it's colour and if the mouse were to click on the box again it would stop.

### Future Development
- Want to put the boxes in some kind of neater order and refine the movement and colour switching a bit.

I have decided to make a work based on the theme of glitches. My first idea towards this idea would be to have some objects glitch out every now and then. I used boxes since they're the most simple object shape which would make it easier to manipulate and get ideas on how the code would be working. I then wanted to have the boxes glitch out when the mouse hovers over the boxes to symbolise the troubles hidden within people.

I wanted to try and see if I can get a box to stay glitching out. To do this I will have the users click on the box to make it stay glitching out and then they can click on it again to make it not glitch.

I have an idea which is to have the boxes constantly moving and then have them stay in one spot when they glitch out.
